title: Migration from Publify to Jekyll!
---

I've been thinking about this for a while, and so today I decided to migrate from my <a href="https://github.com/danogwok/publify" target="_blank">Publify version</a> that i forked from the original creators (https://github.com/publify/publify.git). Well i loved publify with it's fancy backend, and non-existent support :), but with time opted for a more trendy blogging system.

I decided to use <a href="http://www.barryclark.co" target="_blank">Barry Clark's</a> Jekyll-Now, just because he works at Trello and I'm loving Jekyll so far.
