title: The need for version control
---

<p>Version control, also called Revision control and Source control is a tool that I would say is absolutely required. Version control systems are essential for any kind of distributed, collaborative development or individual projects. Have you ever?</p>
<ul>
<li>Made a change to code, realized it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?</li>
<li>Lost code? Or had a backup that was too old?</li>
<li>Had to maintain numerous versions of code?</li>
<li>Wanted to see the difference between different versions of your code?</li>
<li>Wanted to prove that a particular change broke or fixed your code?</li>
<li>Wanted to submit a change to someone else’s code?</li>
<li>Wanted to share your code, or let other people work on your code?</li>
<li>Wanted to experiment with new features without messing up your original code?</li>
</ul>

<p>As you work with files that are under version control, every change to your files is tracked. All these changes are bundled into a commit as a single action before they are pushed to the remote repository. Version Control has been around for a while, much longer than most people thing. A brief run through some of the commonest Version Control Systems;</p>
<ul>
<li>CVS, has been around for a long time. Client applications include Tortoise CVS on Windows.</li>
<li>SVN, Subversion is another Version Control System—Google Code uses it</li>
<li>Git, is a fast growing Distributed Version control system. Distributed Version Control systems have one centralized code base, where the code is pulled from e.g. GITHUB</li>
<li>Mercurial(open source distributed version control system like Git, )</li>
<li>After you start using it, version control is almost impossible to live without.</li>
</ul>
